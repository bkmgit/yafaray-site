YafaRay is a free open-source montecarlo raytracing engine released under the 
[LGPL 2.1 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html). Raytracing is 
a rendering technique for generating realistic images by tracing the path of 
light through a 3D scene. A render engine consists of a specialised computer 
program that interacts with a host 3D application to provide specific 
raytracing capabilities "on demand". The YafaRay engine can be used in the 
following 3D applications: [Blender](https://www.blender.org), 
[Edificius](https://www.accasoftware.com/en/3d-building-design-software), 
[pCon-planner](https://pcon-planner.com) and [Wings 3D](http://www.wings3d.com/).
